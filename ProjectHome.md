Prototype-Driven Learning for Sequence Models
By Aria Haghighi and Dan Klein, HLT-NAACL-2006
http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/~aria42/pubs/naacl06-posinduction.pdf

This toolkit can be used to train and run sequence models for a variety of tasks from part-of-speech tagging as well as information extraction.

All that is required is raw un-annotated text and a prototype file describing the type of annotation you are interested in modeling. Please email aria42@cs.berkeley.edu with questions.
